Welcome to Youtify!
===================

**Youtify** is a web application that translates
Spotify playlists into Youtube playlists and viceversa.
It pulls data from the `Spotify API <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/>`_
and `Youtube API <https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/>`_  and automatically creates the playlist
on your account.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
